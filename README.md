## Introduction
As the most populous city in the United States with 8.8 million people distributed over 300.46 square miles (U.S Census Bureau, 2020), New York City has experienced rapid and widespread transmission since the first confirmed case on March 1st 2020. At the end of March 2020, NYC arrived at the peak of COVID-19 and became the pandemic epicenter (Cordes \& Castro, 2020) with a weekly mean of 5132 diagnosed cases and 1,566 hospital admissions. On March 22, 2020, 'New York State on PAUSE' executive order was declared. It includes a new directive that all non-essential businesses statewide must close in-office personnel functions effective (New York State Official Website, 2020). Identifying the spatio-temporal changes of human mobility pattern before, during and after the outbreak of COVID-19 is important in order to analyze COVID-19’s impact on individuals. In addition, analyzing mobility changes under the contextual backgrounds suggests the heterogeneity of COVID-19’s impacts on different groups. For example, high-income individuals may choose to decrease their visits to wholesale markets and restaurants and buy takeaways services to access necessary foods. 
However, people with low- or moderate- incomes may have no choice but to leave home to buy food with higher risk of infection.
Therefore, the objective of this project is to study the spatio-temporal changes of mobility pattern in NYC in March 2019, March 2020 and March 2021 and analyze the social equity issues caused by the pandemic. 

## Data
This map uses the smart-device pattern data from December to January in 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 from SafeGraph. In addition, this study collect ACS 2019 5-year data to analyze mobility pattern in different race and income contexts to discuss the social equity issues and make policy implications of travel restrictions for the local government. 

Instead of collecting data of ZCTA level at first, I gather the data of census tract level since this is much more precise. Here is the data source:
|     Data     | Geographic Level |           Source            | 
| :------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | 
|    Mobility Pattern Data   | Block Group  |    [SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/)    | 
| Core Place Data | Block Group  |     [SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/)             | 
| Demographic Data e.g. median income, race | Census Tract |     [ACS 2019 5-year data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html)       |
| Geographic boundary Data | Census Tract |   [US Census Bureau](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/census-download-metadata.page)       |
